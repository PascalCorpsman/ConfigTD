### Features
- 1 to 16 player (theoretically there is no limitiation to the player count, but in reallity the game does not support more than 65535 enemies at the map, which gives a upper limit for the playercount)
- client-server based (server runs in console mode, so dedicated server is possible)
- multiplatform Windows / Linux (matches can mix OS types)
- LAN and WAN playable (for WAN mode you need a port forwarding to the server)

## What needs to be done to play the game

Read carefully the [manual](manual.md) or

1. Clone or download this repository to your harddrive
2. Start the "config_td" client supposed for your operating system (Linux 64 or Win64 are supported by default, for other OS you need to compile the source by yourself) ![](game_started.png)
3. Click "Host Game" if you are the first player and do not use a dedicated server, otherwise click "Join Game" ![](host_game.png)
4. Fill in your Player name and click on "Create" ![](select_map.png)
5. Select "Load Map" ![](select_G1_map.png)
6. Select the G1 map (side note: every map that has a description is "defined" and playable, all the other maps are in "development" state) and hit "Play" (Attention, if you want to play with multiple players, only hit load and wait until all players connected to the game) ![](select_difficulty.png)
7. Select the difficulty you want to play the map. ![](in_game.png)
8. Hit "P" to pause the game and take a look what the map offers you and how to play. The "G1" map is a defeating map, so you do not need to maze here, place all the buildings you buy onto the blue area and enjoy the game. Can you defeat all 12 waves in hard mode ?

To be able to compile the code you need the [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)

Inside Lazarus you need to install the following packages:
- L-Net from [here](https://github.com/almindor/lnet) or use the online Packagemanager to install
- LazOpenGLContext (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")
- TaChartLazarusPkg (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")

Additional you need to download:
