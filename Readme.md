### Features
- 1 to 16 player (theoretically there is no limitiation to the player count, but in reallity the game does not support more than 65535 enemies at the map, which gives a upper limit for the playercount)
- client-server based (server runs in console mode, so dedicated server is possible)
- multiplatform Windows / Linux (matches can mix OS types)
- LAN and WAN playable (for WAN mode you need a port forwarding to the server)
- load / save of game, even in multiplayer mode (including automated bakups after each complete wave)
- pause / timespeedup x2, x4 
- ingame Chat
- game statistics (at the end of a match in detail, during the game only kills and money )
- hinting system (CTRL + left mouse button gives a "!" that everyone can see)
- 2 orthogonal gaming modes (Coop vs. Head to Head / Mazing vs. defeating) => 4 game variants
- 3 choosable difficulty levels
- 4 damage classes (typically labeled as Stich, Poison, Magic, Air)

## What needs to be done to play the game

1. Clone or download this repository to your harddrive
2. Read the [overview](documentation/overview.md) document as needed

## Why is there no sound ?

Actual the game is (at least at the moment) not designed to use sounds. This is due to the following reasons:
- adds lots of complexity
- disturbes when played with thousands of units on the map
- game is designed for LAN-Parties, where everyone talks to each other, all the sound effects will then mess up the room sound and typically are switched of anyway

It could be possible that in future these arguments change and sound support will be added.

## What needs to be done to compile the game

To be able to compile the code you need the [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)

Inside Lazarus you need to install the following packages:
- L-Net from [here](https://github.com/almindor/lnet) or use the online Packagemanager to install
- LazOpenGLContext (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")
- TaChartLazarusPkg (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")

Additional you need to download:
- [DGLOpenGL](https://github.com/saschawillems/dglopengl)
- [Synapse](http://www.ararat.cz/synapse/doku.php/download)
