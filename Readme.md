# Config Tower Defense (Config TD)

Config TD is a Opensource and free Tower Defense clone with the aim of maximal configurabillity and as easy as possible map creation for single and multiplayer matches.

It supports multiple graphical themes and is client server based. 

The game follows the genre typical mechanics and consists of buildings that can be bought, opponents (often called "creeps") and even hero's (like buildings but moveable). <br>
Creeps are send in waves. The player has to defeat them all, if not the player looses one life per creep. The match is finished on one of two choises

* the player lost all lifes -> player loose
* the player defeated all waves -> player wins

If not in playing mode the game is always in editor mode, so the game is editor and game in one program. Maps can be played during creation which makes map creation the same fun as playing the maps.

### Features
- 1 to 16 player (theoretically there is no limitiation to the player count, but in reallity the game does not support more than 65535 enemies at the map, which gives a upper limit for the playercount) (also the bandwidth which is used and the rendering performance of the computer could limit the game)
- client-server based (server runs in console mode, so dedicated server is possible)
- multiplatform Windows / Linux (matches can mix OS types)
- LAN and WAN playable (for WAN mode you need a port forwarding to the server)
- load / save of game, even in multiplayer mode (including automated bakups after each completed wave)
- pause / timewarp (speedup x2, x4)
- ingame chat
- game statistics (at the end of a match in detail, during the game only kills and money )
- hinting system (CTRL + left mouse button gives a "!" that everyone can see)
- 2 orthogonal gaming modes (Coop vs. Head to Head / Mazing vs. defeating) => 4 game variants
- 3 choosable difficulty levels
- 4 damage classes (typically labeled as Stich, Poison, Magic, Air)
- 2 kinds of opponent movements (Floor- / Airunits)
- all settings of the map / game can be edited at the same time by all player, there is no game leader. This allows multiple players to define the map and waves at the same time during gameplay

## What needs to be done to play the game

1. Clone or download this repository to your harddrive
2. Read the [overview](documentation/Readme.md) document as needed

## Why is there no sound ?

Actual the game is (at least at the moment) not designed to use sounds. This is due to the following reasons:
- adds lots of complexity
- disturbes when played with thousands of units on the map
- game is designed for LAN-Parties, where everyone talks to each other, all the sound effects will then mess up the room sound and typically are switched of anyway

It could be possible that in future these arguments change and sound support will be added.

## What needs to be done to compile the game

To be able to compile the code you need the [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)

Inside Lazarus you need to install the following packages:
- L-Net from [here](https://github.com/almindor/lnet) or use the online Packagemanager to install
- LazOpenGLContext (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")
- TaChartLazarusPkg (comes with lazarus, install via "Package" -> "Install Packages")

Additional you need to download:
- [DGLOpenGL](https://github.com/saschawillems/dglopengl)
- [Synapse](http://www.ararat.cz/synapse/doku.php/download)
