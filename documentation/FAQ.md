Q: i updated the game with the launcher and now i get strange warnings when running the "check and save map" button. <br>
A: The launcher does not delete any files during update, so this warnings can occur, if files have been renamed. Best way to get rid of this is by deleting the map and its copy in the "share" folder and then redownload it by the launcher.
